# Research Findings: Interactive Portfolio Site

## Technology Stack Research

### React + TypeScript Framework
**Decision**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety and modern features
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for portfolio sites
- Strong ecosystem for UI components
- Excellent performance with Vite build tool
- TypeScript provides development-time error catching

**Alternatives considered**: Vue.js (less ecosystem), Angular (overkill for portfolio), vanilla JS (lack of structure)

### Firebase Hosting + Firestore
**Decision**: Firebase for hosting, authentication, and data storage
**Rationale**:
- Free hosting tier with good performance
- Built-in authentication for potential admin features
- Firestore for storing portfolio data and chat sessions
- CDN distribution and SSL certificates included

**Alternatives considered**: Vercel (no database), Netlify (no backend), AWS (complexity overhead)

### Gemini AI Integration
**Decision**: Google's Gemini Pro API for chatbot functionality
**Rationale**:
- Competitive pricing and performance
- Good context understanding for professional conversations
- Reliable API with good documentation
- Fits well with Firebase ecosystem

**Alternatives considered**: OpenAI GPT-4 (higher cost), Claude API (newer/less stable), local models (performance issues)

### AI SDK UI + Tailwind CSS
**Decision**: Vercel's AI SDK UI components with Tailwind CSS styling
**Rationale**:
- Pre-built chat components reduce development time
- Tailwind provides utility-first CSS approach
- Modern, responsive design patterns
- Good accessibility defaults

**Alternatives considered**: Custom chat UI (time-consuming), Material-UI (heavy), Chakra UI (less flexibility)

## Architecture Patterns

### Data Integration Strategy
**Decision**: JSON-based data files for resume/LinkedIn information with Firestore caching
**Rationale**:
- Version controlled portfolio content
- Fast loading with Firestore caching
- Easy updates without database migrations
- Offline capability

### State Management
**Decision**: React Context + useReducer for global state, React Query for server state
**Rationale**:
- Avoid Redux complexity for portfolio-sized application
- React Query handles API caching and synchronization
- Context provides clean prop-drilling solution

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library + Cypress for comprehensive testing
**Rationale**:
- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for user workflows
- E2E tests for critical paths including chatbot
- Constitutional requirement for TDD approach

## Performance Optimization

### Bundle Optimization
**Decision**: Vite with code splitting and lazy loading
**Rationale**:
- Fast development server and build times
- Automatic code splitting for route-based loading
- Tree shaking for minimal bundle size

### Content Delivery
**Decision**: Firebase CDN with image optimization and caching
**Rationale**:
- Global edge locations for fast loading
- Automatic image optimization
- Browser caching strategies

## Accessibility Implementation

### WCAG Compliance
**Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with automated testing
**Rationale**:
- Professional portfolio requirement
- axe-core integration for automated testing
- Semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support

### Screen Reader Support
**Decision**: Comprehensive screen reader support for all interactions
**Rationale**:
- Inclusive design principle
- AI chatbot requires careful ARIA implementation
- Dynamic content announcements
