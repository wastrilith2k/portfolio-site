# Feature Specification: Interactive Portfolio Site

**Feature Branch**: `001-portfolio-site-talking`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "portfolio site talking about me and the projects I've worked on with the information from both my resume and my linkedin profile. I do want it to also be able to take that information and be able to chat with a chat bot about me. Build it in react, use Firebase for Hosting and Gemini for the API interactions. Use the AI SDK UI (from Anthropic) for the styling as well as tailwinds"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A visitor lands on the portfolio site to learn about the site owner's professional background, skills, and project experience. They can browse through traditional portfolio sections and also engage with an interactive chatbot to ask specific questions about the owner's experience, projects, or capabilities in a conversational format.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor arrives at the portfolio site, **When** they navigate through the site, **Then** they can view comprehensive information about the owner's background, skills, and projects sourced from resume and LinkedIn profile data
2. **Given** a visitor wants to learn specific details, **When** they interact with the chatbot, **Then** they receive accurate, contextual responses about the owner's professional experience and projects
3. **Given** a visitor asks the chatbot a question, **When** the bot processes the query, **Then** it provides relevant information based on the owner's resume and LinkedIn profile data
4. **Given** a visitor is browsing on any device, **When** they access the site, **Then** the interface adapts responsively to provide optimal viewing and interaction experience

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the chatbot receives a question outside the scope of professional information?
- How does the system handle when LinkedIn or resume data is unavailable?
- What occurs when the AI API is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the site perform when accessed from slow network connections?
