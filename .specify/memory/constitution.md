# Portfolio Site Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-First Development
Every feature MUST begin with a complete specification that defines user scenarios,
functional requirements, and acceptance criteria before any implementation.
No code development may begin without an approved specification that clearly
articulates what will be built and why it provides user value.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written before implementation code. All tests MUST fail initially,
then implementation code is written to make tests pass. The Red-Green-Refactor
cycle is strictly enforced. No feature is considered complete without
comprehensive test coverage including unit, integration, and contract tests.

### III. User-Centered Design
All features MUST directly serve user needs with clear value propositions.
Technical complexity is only justified when it directly supports user requirements.
Features MUST be designed from the user's perspective first, then technical
implementation follows to support those user goals.

### IV. Iterative Planning & Execution
Development MUST follow the systematic workflow: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement.
Each phase produces concrete artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) that guide
the next phase. Implementation happens in small, testable increments with
continuous validation against specifications.

### V. Portfolio Excellence
As a portfolio project, code quality MUST demonstrate professional best practices.
This includes clean code architecture, comprehensive documentation, responsive
design, accessibility compliance, and performance optimization. Every aspect
reflects technical competency and attention to detail.

## Development Standards

All code MUST follow modern web development best practices including responsive
design principles, semantic HTML, accessible interfaces (WCAG compliance),
cross-browser compatibility, and optimized performance metrics. Security
considerations MUST be integrated throughout development, not added as an afterthought.

## Quality Assurance

Code review is REQUIRED for all changes. Automated testing MUST pass before
any merge. Performance benchmarks MUST be maintained. Documentation MUST be
updated with all changes. The project MUST always be in a deployable state
demonstrating portfolio-quality standards.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require
documented justification and version updates following semantic versioning.
All development decisions MUST align with these principles. Complexity deviations
MUST be explicitly justified in planning documents with rationale for why
simpler alternatives are insufficient.
